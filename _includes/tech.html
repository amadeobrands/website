          Working from Amsterdam means that we are as close as possible to the AMS-IX. Also, our multi-data
          center with fully synchronized nodes standby allows for high availability. With our server farm managed
          by an experienced team and 24x7 monitoring in place, we can ensure quick response times.<br><br>

          As EOS Amsterdam, we aim to avoid centralization by not using any of the popular cloud hosting
          platforms in the second stage. In the first stage, when the software only utilizes one CPU core, we will
          use the Google Cloud Platform to determine future sizing. <br><br>
          More information on our testnet servers can be found below.

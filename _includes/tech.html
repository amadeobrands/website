          Working from Amsterdam means that we are as close as possible to the AMS-IX. Also, our multi-datacenter with fully synchronized nodes standby make high-availability possible. With our security managed by an official company and 24x7 monitoring in place, we can ensure quick response times. As EOS Amsterdam, we avoid centralization by not using any of the popular cloud hosting platforms. More information on our servers can be found below.

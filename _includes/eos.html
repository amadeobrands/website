          We have people, budget and experience available to operate the block producer infrastructure. Our
          people have extensive experience in managing high profile banking, identity and website environments
          â€“ and protecting them from cyberattacks including DDoS. We have been developing and operating
          trading platforms for multiple years. Our team is available 24x7.

        <h4 class="service-heading">DEVELOP</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We want to invest in building infrastructure and distributed
          applications that offer real value for our community. Our
          investments will most likely go to apps and dapps on topics
          such as on-boarding, identity, reputation, security and
          usability of the platform.

          We navigate on global human values such as freedom, privacy
          and property. And comply with the European rules that have
          translated these values into laws. This means e.g. that we
          work on a privacy-by-design basis, as required under EU
          law. We advise on and try to ensure contract and ownership
          compatibility within the existing legal framework.

        <p class="text-muted">

          We organize meetups and workshops for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to evangelize the
          power of the concepts behind EOS. We also plan to help on-board companies by providing lectures and
          on-premise training. Our team of crypto specialists focuses on helping to build and operate the
          infrastructure to support the EOS community.

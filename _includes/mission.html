          Goedendag! We are EOS Amsterdam. Originating from the Netherlands, we
          have always excelled at global trading and connecting the world. This
          goes back as far as the seventeenth century. Our habitat?  That is the
          capital of this country – a prosperous city with a well-educated,
          liberal and internationally oriented population. Additionally, the
          Amsterdam Internet Exchange is close by. This is the second largest
          internet exchange in the world based on the number of connected
          members and amount of internet traffic.

            Because we are a legal entity registered in the
            Netherlands, we can be held responsible for our actions,
            changes, failures and investments. We stay in close
            contact with our community. The Netherlands is a mature
            democracy and a stable member of the European Union.

            Dutch, and especially Amsterdam people, are well known for their liberal minds and their open view to
            the world. It is the people’s minds that host such an important internet hub function.

            People, budget and experience; everything is already in
            place to set up and monitor the block producer
            infrastructure. The result? We are able to operate independently.
